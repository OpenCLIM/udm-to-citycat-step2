  summary: >
    The UDM to City Cat model prepares the building and greenspace files for City Cat.

  description: >
    When running CityCat on DAFNI - this Step 2 model is included within the CityCat model itself and therefore will not be needed 
    in the workflow. If CityCat is to be run off DAFNI, then this model converts the building and greenspace shapefiles into the 
    text files needed to run CityCat.
